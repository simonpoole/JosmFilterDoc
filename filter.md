## Basics

| Syntax                         | Description |
|---                             |--- |
| _substr_                       | matches if _substr_ appears in any **key or value** <br /><br />(e.g. `wa` matches both `natural=water` and `highway=path`) <br /><br /> Whitespace or special characters in the search string ( `:`, `(`, `)`, `\|`, `^`, `=`, `~`, `?`, `<`, `>`, `"` ) need to be escaped by prefixing them with `\` (e.g. `area\:highway`), or the whole string needs to be enclosed in double quotes (e.g. `"area:highway"`). Double quotes that are part of the search string always need to be escaped with `\` (e.g. `"abc:de\"fg"`). |
| _key_**:**_valuefragment_      | _valuefragment_ anywhere in _key_. `name:str` matches name=Bakerstreet |
| **-**_key_**:**_valuefragment_ | _valuefragment_ nowhere in _key_ |
| _key_**:**                     | matches if exact _key_ exists |
| _key_**?**                     | matches if _key_ has a truthy value (`true`, `yes`, `1`, `on`) |
| _key_**=**_value_              | _key_ with exactly _value_ |
| _key_**~**_regexp_             | _key_ and value matches _regexp_, supported in JOSM since 16260 |
| *key*__=*__                    | _key_ with any value |
| _key_**=**                     | _key_ with empty value |
| __*=__*value*                  | _value_ in any key |
| _key_**>**_value_              | matches if _key_ is greater than _value_ (analogously, less than _<_) |
| \"key\"=\"value\"              | enclosed key and value in quotes to quote operators.<br>Within quoted strings the __"__ and __\\__ characters need to be escaped " by a preceding __\\__ (e.g. __\\"__ and __\\\\__)., name=\"Baker Street\", \"addr:street\" |

## Examples for matching objects in relations

| Example                                                            | Description |
|---                           |--- |
|type:way & child type:relation                                     | Match all ways of all reations |
| type:way & child type:relation & child type=multipolygon          | Match all ways of all reations that are multipolygons | 
| type:way & role:outer & child type:relation                       | Match all ways with role:outer of all reations |
| type:way & role:outer & child id:_id_                             | Match all ways with role:outer of a reation with a certain _id_|
|type:node & child type:way & child child id:14297825               | Match nodes of ways in the relation with id=14297825 (e.g. a multipolygon). Multipolygons are relations that have ways as members. The nodes in the multipolygon in-turn are children of ways which are members of the multipolygon. Consequently the child operator needs be applied recursively to match them. |
